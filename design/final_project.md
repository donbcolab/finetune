## Build-Share Report: Lite VLMs for Medical/Life Sciences Applications

### Build
**Problem worth solving:**
Accurately describing cell imaging is critical for research and diagnostics in the medical and life sciences fields. Manual analysis is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge, while scalable, automated solutions are needed to improve efficiency and accuracy.

**Potential LLM Solution:**
Develop a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM) that can describe cell imaging accurately. This model will leverage prompt tuning, evaluate different PaliGemma architectures, multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning on medical datasets.

**Target Audience:**
- Medical researchers
- Healthcare providers
- Biopharmaceutical companies
- Medical imaging professionals

#### Key Metrics
- Description accuracy of cell images
- Time taken to generate descriptions
- User satisfaction and feedback from medical professionals

#### Data Sources for RAG and Fine-Tuning
- **Public datasets**: Vision-FLAN, LAION
- **Medical-specific datasets**: MIMIC-III, PubMedQA, ChestX-ray14, APTOS
- **Custom datasets**: Cell imaging datasets from research institutions and hospitals

#### Implementation Steps

##### 1. Prompt Tuning
- **Objective**: Optimize the model's ability to generate accurate and relevant descriptions of cell images using carefully crafted prompts.
- **Method**: Experiment with different prompt structures and wording to guide the model’s responses effectively.

##### 2. PaliGemma Architecture Comparison
- **Objective**: Evaluate the performance of various PaliGemma model architectures for describing cell images.
- **Models to Compare**: 
  - PaliGemma Pretrained Models (PT)
  - PaliGemma Mix Models
  - PaliGemma Fine-Tuned Models (FT)
- **Method**: Fine-tune each model architecture on the medical-specific datasets and compare their performance based on key metrics.

##### 3. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Objective**: Enhance the model’s performance by incorporating multi-modal RAG to retrieve relevant information from large datasets.
- **Method**: Implement RAG with both text and image modalities to improve the context and accuracy of generated descriptions.

##### 4. Fine-Tuning
- **Objective**: Further refine the model's performance for the specific task of describing cell images.
- **Method**: Fine-tune the best-performing PaliGemma model using medical-specific datasets such as MIMIC-III, PubMedQA, and cell imaging datasets.
